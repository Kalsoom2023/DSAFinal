# Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer

## Overview
The **Data Structures and Algorithms Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize fundamental data structures and algorithms. Built using Python and Pygame, the project aims to provide an engaging and educational experience for students, educators, and enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Visualize Data Structures**:
  - Arrays and Lists
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Hash Tables

- **Algorithm Visualization**:
  - Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Graph Traversal (e.g., BFS, DFS)
  - Tree Traversals (e.g., Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

- **Interactive Interface**:
  - Step-by-step execution of algorithms
  - Intuitive and dynamic visual feedback

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following modules:

- **`conversions/`**: Contains modules for data type conversions.
- **`datastruct/`**: Implements core data structures like arrays, linked lists, and stacks.
- **`Graphs/`**: Handles graph-related algorithms and representations.
- **`hash/`**: Implements hash tables and related functionalities.
- **`sorting/`**: Includes sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **`Trees/`**: Implements tree structures and algorithms like traversals.
- **`MainWindow.py`**: The main script that integrates all modules and launches the visualizer.
- **`videos/`**: Stores tutorial or demo videos showcasing the visualizer in action.
